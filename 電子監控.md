#electronicmonitoring #sanction 

Electronic monitoring is a technology used in the criminal justice system in order to track and monitor the offenders. (Crowe et al., 2002)
Ardley (2005) defines electronic monitoring as a system of house arrest aimed at tracking, controlling, and altering the defendant's or the perpetrator's behaviour.
Levin (2011) defines electronic monitoring as an alternative sanction within the community and a tool of supervision in probation, which provides an alternative to imprisonment.

In the Council of Europe member states, electronic monitoring is used in the following ways, as: 
- a main sanction 
- an alternative sanction 
- a way of implementing the prison sentence 
- a condition of parole 
- a condition related to dropping of charges, sentence, or the implementation of the sentence (Council of Europe Annual Penal Statistic II, 2011).
