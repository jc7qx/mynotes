#electronicmonitoring #sanction 

Electronic monitoring is a technology used in the criminal justice system in order to track and monitor the offenders. (Crowe et al., 2002)
Ardley (2005) defines electronic monitoring as a system of house arrest aimed at tracking, controlling, and altering the defendant's or the perpetrator's behaviour.
Levin (2011) defines electronic monitoring as an alternative sanction within the community and a tool of supervision in probation, which provides an alternative to imprisonment.
