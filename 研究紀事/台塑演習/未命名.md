The engineering team troubleshooting network issues observes unusual ICS protocol communications (OPC, IEC104, Modbus/TCP, DNP3, ICCP, etc.) on the network. For example, there are unusual scanning rates of OPC to and from SCADA servers to outstations and other devices at several levels of the Purdue network architecture. 工程人對網路進行檢修時發現不尋常的通信協定的通訊(OPC, IEC104, Modbus/TCP, DNP3, ICCP, ...)。例如，不尋常的OPC掃描速率

As an example, the CRASHOVERRIDE ICS attack framework can abuse the IEC-104 protocol, has built-in features to abuse other ICS protocols such as OPO, and has the potential to expand to also abuse DNP3.

**DISCUSSION:** Are your legitimate in-use ICS protocols in a list or baselined? Is ICS-specific (ICS protocol-aware) Network Security Monitoring (NSM) visibility deployed at Levels 0-3 of the Purdue model for IPFIX or full packet captures?

**TEAMS:** Engineering, Cybersecurity, Safety, ICS Network Architects.

**PROTECTION:** ICS-specific network monitoring – ICS deep packet inspection and ICS dissectors in use.

**DETECTION:** Trained ICS cybersecurity team members using ICS NSM and investigating suspected events in order to initiate incident response.

**RESPONSE:** ICS incident response playbook with required teams, check integrity of field devices and operations, loss of control = emergency.
