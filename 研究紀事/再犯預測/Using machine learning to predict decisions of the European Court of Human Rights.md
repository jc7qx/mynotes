* using language analysis and automatic information extraction in order to facilitate statistical research in the legal domain.
* demonstrate and discuss the possibilities of Natural Language Processing techniques for automatically predicting judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).
* use a computer to perform quantitative analysis on the basis of the words and phrases that were used in a court case and then based on that analysis ‘teach’ the computer to predict the decision of the Court.
* which words made the most impact on this decision and thus identify what factors are important for the judicial decisions.
* use supervised machine learning, the computer is provided with (textual) information from many court cases together with the actual judgements.
* analyses texts of judgements of ECtHR cases available on the Court’s website and predicts whether any particular article of ECHR was violated.
* Support Vector Machine (SVM) Linear Classifier
* k-fold cross-validation
