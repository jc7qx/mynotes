* a systematic framework for working through an imbalanced classification dataset
* favorite algorithm or worked previously
* select a metric, spot check algorithms, spot check imhalanced algorithms, hyperparameter tuning
* evaluating candidate algorithms requires the careful design of a test harness, often involving the use of [k-fold cross-validation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/) to estimate the performance of a given model on unseen data
