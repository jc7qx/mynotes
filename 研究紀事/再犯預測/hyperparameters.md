The best hyperparameters will vary between datasets, so we have to perform optimization (also called model tuning) separately on each datasets.

we might optimize in a random forest are the number of decision trees, the maximum depth of each decision tree, the maximum number of features considered for splitting each node, and the maximum number of data points required in a leaf node.
